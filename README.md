## VoteQuik

VoteQuik is a real time voting application. This project was built over the course of a 2 day
hackathon. The goal was to demonstrate the real time cababilities of a Firebase
when combined with AngularJS. 

#### Description
* Users can sign up for accounts and post polls
* Users can vote as many times as they want positively or negatively for a particular event
* Sentiment is displayed in real time with visualizations 
* Users can comment on polls and comments are displayed in real time

#### Data Binding
* The application demonstrates the data binding capabilities of AngularJS and Firbase
* The application uses three way data binds so the view, the model, and the Firebase backend are synced in real time
* As users vote the visualizations update in real time
* The application uses custom angular directives, the directives use d3 to build the visualizations
